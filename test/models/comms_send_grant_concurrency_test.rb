# Real concurrency for the send grant (WhatsApp spec §5): threads with their
# own database connections and committed rows, coordinated so the
# interleaving that used to revive or keep a grant is forced. Every path
# that sets or clears can_send takes the connection's row lock first, then
# the access row, and reads both fresh; these tests fail without that. Each
# thread's result is asserted explicitly (assert_thread_ok /
# assert_thread_raised): an exception is never taken for success. Not
# transactional; the rows made here are removed in teardown.
